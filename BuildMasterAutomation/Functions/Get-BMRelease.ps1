{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Gets the release for an application in BuildMaster.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Get-BMRelease` function gets releases in BuildMaster. It uses the
    [Release and Build Deployment API](https://docs.inedo.com/docs/buildmaster-reference-api-release-and-build).

    To get a specific release, pass a release object, release ID, or release name to the `Release` parameter.

    To get all the releases for a specific application, pass an application object, application ID, or application name to the `Application` parameter. You can get a specific application's release by passing the release's name to the `Name` parameter.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-BMRelease -Session $session -Release $release

    Demonstrates how to get a specific release by passing a release object to the `Release` parameter. The `Get-BMRelease` function looks for an `id` or `name` property on the object.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-BMRelease -Session $session -Application $app

    Demonstrates how to get all the releases for an application by passing an application object to the `Application` parameter. The application object must have a`Application_Id`, `id`, `Application_Name`, or `name` properties.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-BMRelease -Session $session -Application 34

    Demonstrates how to get all the releases for an application by passing its ID to the `Application` parameter.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-BMRelease -Session $session -Application 'BuildMasterAutomation'

    Demonstrates how to get all the releases for an application by passing its name to the `Application` parameter.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-BMRelease -Session $session -Application 'BuildMasterAutomation' -Name '4.1'

    Demonstrates how to get a specific release for an application by passing the release's name to the `Name` parameter.  In this example, the '4.1' release will be returned, if it exists.
