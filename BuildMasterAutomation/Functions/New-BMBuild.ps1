{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Creates a new package for a release.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `New-BMPackage` creates a new package/version/build of an application. In order to deploy an application, the application must have a release. Then you create packages in that release, and each package is then deployed using the release's pipeline.

    .EXAMPLE
    New-BMPackage -Session $session -Release $release

    Demonstrates how to create a new package in the `$release` release. BuildMaster detects what application based on the release (since releases are always tied to applications). Verion numbers and package numbers are incremented and handled based on the release settings.

    The `$release` parameter can be:

    * A release object with an `id` property.
    * A release ID integer.

    .EXAMPLE
    New-BMPackage -Session $session -ReleaseName '53' -Application $applicatoin

    Demonstrates how to create a new package by using the release's name. Since release names are only unique within an application, you must also specify the application via the `Application` parameter.

    .EXAMPLE
    New-BMPackage -Session $session -Release $release -PacakgeName '56.develop' -Variable @{ ProGetPackageName = '17.1.54+developer.deadbee' }

    Demonstrates how to create a release with a specific name, `56.develop`, and with a package-level variable, `ProGetPackageName`.
