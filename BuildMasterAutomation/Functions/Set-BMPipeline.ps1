{

    .SYNOPSIS
    Creates a new pipeline in BuildMaster.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `New-BMPipeline` function creates a new pipeline in BuildMaster and retuns an object representing the new pipeline. In order to deploy an application, you must create a release for that application. Each release gets assigned a pipeline, which are the set of steps to do when releasing and deploying. Pipelines can belong to a specific application or shared between applications.

    The pipeline is created with no stages. The following settings are enabled:

    * Enforce pipeline stage order for deployments

    The following settings are disabled:

    * Cancel earlier (lower-sequenced) releases that are still active and have not yet been deployed.
    * Create a new release by incrementing the final part after a release has been deployed.
    * Mark the release and package as deployed once it reaches the final stage.

    This function uses [BuildMaster's native API](http://inedo.com/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/api/native).

    .EXAMPLE
    New-BMPipeline -Session $session -Name 'Powershell Module'

    Demonstrates how to create a new pipeline that is not used by any applications. In this example a pipeline named `PowerShell Module` will be created.

    .EXAMPLE
    New-BMPipeline -Session $session -Name 'PowerShell Module' -Application $app

    Demonstrates how to create a new pipeline and assign it to a specific application. In this example, the pipeline will be called `PowerShell Module` and it will be assigned to the `$app` application.
